 Tonight we believe we're on track to win this election

1
 from The New York Times unlikable borrow. This is a daily today. So we'll be going to the US Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop

3
 it over to every vote is counted. Every ballot is

1
 counted Joe Biden is calling for patients and President Trump is threatening legal action as me. Millions of votes are still uncounted. We don't want them to find any balance at four o'clock in the morning add them to the list.

3
 Okay? It's got to take time to count the votes. We're going to win

1
 Pennsylvania Alex burns on where the election stands and the remaining paths to Victory. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly. We did win this election. It's Wednesday, November 4th. As ballot counting continued overnight Joe Biden expanded his lead in Arizona and took slightly. It's into crucial Midwestern states, Wisconsin and Michigan where mail-in ballots heavily favored him in Pennsylvania. Biden has won the counted absentee ballots by an overwhelming margin so far and the times reports that if he carries the remaining ballots by a similar margin, He would win the state.

 Alex you have to unmute yourself. Hello, the reflex is a little slow at this hour a little bit. Well, good morning, Alex.

4
 It's some kind of

2
 warning. Well, it is 1:40 a.m. In the morning. And a lot of people are going to be listening to this in a few hours when they wake up and despite being

4
 prepared by you for the

2
 real possibility that we would not have a result on Election night and that the race would seem inconclusive I have to say it feels like we're

1
 in and even

2
 less certain. Then we had anticipated that feel right to you. I'd

4
 certainly a less certain situation than I had anticipated because not only do we not know at this hour who has won the presidential race, but the states that you and I talked about as the early bellwethers to see whether the president's electoral map would hold together. We actually don't have calls in any of them except for Florida at this point, which went for the president. Very good sign for him. We don't have a call in North Carolina all the president is slightly ahead. I don't have a call in Georgia. Also a slightly ahead there though. It looks like that outstanding ballots are pretty heavily in Democratic areas. Don't have a call on Arizona where Joe Biden is ahead by a small but seemingly meaningful margin, you know with maybe hours to go in that count. And that's before we even get to the

2
 Midwest. So yeah, this is a blurry or picture

4
 than I think certainly I had expected or hoped to have at almost two in the

2
 morning you seem displeased. Well, it's just you know, you sort of

4
 want some kind of maybe not full clarity. We knew there was a strong chance that we wouldn't get that but this is I think first

2
 of all a closer election of the poles I had indicated but even once you

4
 get below the level of the

2
 polls closer election than I think we expected the map to give us at this point in the

4
 process.

2
 Let's drill down into these states that you just mentioned states that we had expected. Pected to be called relatively early in the night, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and let's start with Florida. You have long said the scenario in which a Biden Victory would be declared on Election night would be a scenario in which he won Florida a state that was always considered very close. As you said, he did not win Florida the president did so what's the story of what? Happened there in for now.

4
 It's really a pretty extraordinary one that when you look at the counties across the state that we were watching as indicators for where voters in the middle. We're going we're independent voters who were going a Joe Biden did quite well in those places relative to Hillary Clinton for years

2
 ago places like what I

4
 places like Hillsborough County Pinellas County around the city of Tampa up around Jacksonville. He did better than Clinton. Did four years ago, these are traditionally the places that a Democrat needs to make inroads into republican-leaning areas in order to win Statewide. So based on what I just told you you would think that Joe Biden had probably won the state not so because he really drastically underperformed in Miami-Dade County, which is traditionally the Cornerstone of the Democrats popular vote strategy in Florida.

1
 So what happened in

2
 Miami,

4
 Well, you wouldn't necessarily have anticipated this based on the way. He ran his first campaign four years ago, but the president appears to have gained ground really significantly with Hispanic and Latino voters and

2
 it's a distinctive community in

4
 South Florida. It is heavily shaped by the Cuban American population because historically much more conservative than Hispanic voters Nationwide, but the president did even better than you expect a republican to do with Cuban. American voters and with other Hispanic voters in Miami-Dade.

2
 So I was how exactly do you make sense of the way the Latino and the cuban-american vote broke in this all-important County? What's your sense of what motivated these voters to go with the president in greater numbers?

4
 Well, we know that over the last couple of years. The president has made a really concerted effort to improve his standing in South Florida and with Hispanic voters across the State of Florida, and he has done it to a great degree by Rising the Democrats as these left wing radicals who are in League with socialists and who would turn the country into he often doesn't say Cuba offenses

2
 Venezuela

4
 and there is a significant Venezuelan American population in South Florida, but there are clearly voters There For Whom the rhetoric of socialism that you have heard from some folks in the Democratic party, not Joe Biden, but from other very prominent Democrats is a real turnoff and the president and other Democrats in the state have really used that to their great political

2
 advantage. Mm-hmm. Okay, North Carolina. This was a state that President Trump won in 2016 narrowly. It was expected to be closed as of this moment. It remains very close. What can you tell us about? What's going on there in North Carolina? Well, it is very very close

4
 in North Carolina. And it does seem like there is some potential for Biden to close the gap somewhat there. He's trailing by about Anna get seventy seven thousand votes were so right now so a little less than a point. Half many of the outstanding votes appear to be in democratically in the area. So that is a state that is likely going to be decided on the razor's Edge one way or another but based on what we've seen so far. It looks like the story in North Carolina and the story and many other

2
 places

4
 is that you know, Biden did improve upon Democratic performance in the state in the cities and especially in Suburban areas, but that President Trump also improved on his performance in more rural areas. Has and in a state like North Carolina, you have some big cities. You do not have a dominant big city the way you do in a state like Arizona Phoenix and the Phoenix area or even next door in Georgia with the Atlanta metro area being such a force and Statewide politics. And so if you are the Republican candidate you absolutely can make up for setbacks in the suburbs by running up the score board even further and less populous areas that

2
 state so as a question of Our math when it comes to a place like North Carolina a rising tide of Voters and we know that was historic turnout in this race in the case of trump. That means a lot of small gains in a lot of rural counties that just add up and up and up and eventually become a victory potential.

4
 That's right. You know, we don't know where that's going to happen in North Carolina when we have all the votes tabulated. We do know that has happened and a couple other places and this is sort of echo of the 2016 election right when I think there was this Sense reinforced by public holy and private polling by both parties that at the end of the day there just weren't going to be enough rural voters to make up for the president's or at the time candidate Trump's unpopularity and more densely populated areas. Not obviously turned out not to be the case.

2
 Okay next among this early wave of states is George and this has been a republican stronghold unexpectedly it entered Battleground status this year. And so if Biden was Pull off Georgia that seems like it would be a very positive sign for him. That's right. I'm the fact that it is still so

4
 close in Georgia is certainly a hopeful sign for buying that the president is ahead there by about a hundred and fourteen thousand votes with the remaining vote really concentrated in metro Atlanta. This is a state where unfortunately for you and me there have been some pretty distinctive snafu is at the polls a water main break. Oh wow in one crucial facility in Fulton County some difficulties processing ballots. One of the key Suburban counties around Atlanta. So we are going to be waiting a little while to find out exactly what the tally is in those places not be.
